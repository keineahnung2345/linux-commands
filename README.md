For directories (the / after ** is needed in bash to limit it to directories):
```sh
ls -d -1 "$PWD/"**/
```

For files and directories directly under the current directory, whose names contain a .:
```sh

In your script, use `"$1"`, `"$2"`, ... to represent the first, second, ... arguments.

```sh
g++ "$@" -I /usr/local/include/opencv4 -L /usr/local/lib -lopencv_imgcodecs -lopencv_core -lopencv_imgproc -lopencv_highgui -std=c++11
```
And by using:
